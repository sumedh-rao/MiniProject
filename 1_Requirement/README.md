## Parking Managment System

This is a vehicle parking system that tracks vehicle entry. As the population grows, so does the demand for automobiles. Especially in urban areas, where street parking is not permitted. Parking management can help to reduce traffic congestion on the highways. A manual parking system manages the bulk of parking spaces in our country. Our goal is to design and develop a smart car parking system that will eliminate the chaos, bewilderment, and long lines that occur at the entrance and exit of parking spaces placed inside public buildings, such as shopping malls and office buildings.
